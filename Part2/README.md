# Part 2 

The purpose of this program is to see a visual representationo of
the solution to a given differential equation. The equation we
will examine is (x^2 + 4)y'' + y = x. We will solve this DE 
numerically and plot the results.

## Libraries Used / Running the Program

The libraries used are numpy, scipy for odeint, and matplotlib
for pyplot.

To run the program, simply navigate to the directory of the
program and run the following command:

'python part2.py'

## Solution

The output of the program displays the graphical solution to 
the differential equation.
