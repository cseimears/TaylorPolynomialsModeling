# Performance Modeling and Simulation

This is a Python program that models computer performance using a 
naive, holistic model and solves the resulting differential equation 
to simulate the performance over time.

# Dependencies

This program requires the following dependencies:
numpy
matplotlib
scipy

# Usage

To use this program, you need to modify the values of the different
factors that affect computer performance in the code:

'processor_speed = 3.5 # GHz'
'memory_speed = 2400 # MHz'
'storage_size = 1 # TB'
'size_of_data = 100 # GB'
'computational_task_complexity = 10 # arbitrary units'

You can adjust the values of these factors to reflect the 
specifications of your computer system or the system you want to 
model.

# Running

Navigate to the directory of the program and run the command:
'python part3.py'
